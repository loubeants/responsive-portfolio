      <img src="assets/images/portfolioPic" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">
      <p>My name is Loubeants Celestin. I moved to North Carolina six years ago after serving four years in the Marine
        Corps. I am currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp at the University Of North Carolina
        at Charlotte. Upon my completion of the course I will be taking the next couple months to sharpen
        my coding skills. </p>

      <p>I enjoy traveling, seeing the world and experiencing new cultures, and one day I would love to be able to work as a coder while traveling the world. After
        graduation I will be seeking an entry level position as a web developer. <br> In my spare time I love to
        work out, read and code.
